## Assignment 1: Project - Build a Companies API

### Instructions:

### Start a new project from scratch, call it FareWheels.

Your first task is to create a service for managing the list of car companies or manufacturers. So each car has a manufacturer, like GM, Ford, Tesla and so on. We should have an endpoint for getting the list of all the companies, because somewhere in our client applications, perhaps we have a dropdown list for the user to select a company.

We should also be able to add a new company as well as update or delete an existing one.
